Welcome to MySQL Maint, a bash script that perform backups and maintenance over
your MySQL Servers

Installation

Edit the variables DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_PORT at the beginning of the
script, and set it to run as a cron task. Don't forget that the script contains
important information so don't forget to give it strict permissions
(700 is good).
